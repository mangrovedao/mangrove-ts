/* Outputs deployments as follows:

   To a toy ENS instance. Useful for testing when the server & testing script
   are both spawned in-process. Holds additional info on the contracts (whether
   it's a token). In the future, could be either removed (in favor of a
   file-based solution), or expanded (if an onchain addressProvider appears).

   How to use:
   1. Inherit Deployer.
   2. In run(), call outputDeployment() after deploying.

   Do not inherit other deployer scripts, just instantiate them and call their
   .deploy();
