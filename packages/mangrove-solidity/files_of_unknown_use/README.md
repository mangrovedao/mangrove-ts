About the files here: I don't know if they are still useful, or maintained.

Get in touch if you know a file is useful / know it is not.

For e.g. scripst in governance/ if they are still useful, they should be probably be refactored into something easy to use (right now the code is not super clean, the directory is a bit hidden, etc -- it should be part of eg parrot).

# Note

I have removed the `faucet` package for now.
